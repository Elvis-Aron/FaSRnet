 we propose a human pose estimation framework with refinements at feature and semantic levels. 
 We align auxiliary features with the features of current frame to reduce the loss caused by different feature distributions. 
 Then, an attention mechanism is used to fuse auxiliary features with current features. In term of semantic, 
 we utilize the difference information between adjacent heatmaps as auxiliary features to refine the current heatmaps.
